 nginx web/proxy server + OpenResty components + extensions
 Nginx ('engine X') is a high-performance web and reverse proxy server
 created by Igor Sysoev. It can be used both as a standalone web server
 and as a proxy to reduce the load on back-end HTTP or mail servers.
 .
 This package is a opinionated build of Nginx, and is designed to get you up
 and running as quickly as possible, while providing a vast array of tools
 to perform almost any task you might need Nginx to perform.
 .
 UPGRADING:
   - Existing implementations should append 'include /etc/nginx/conf/modules.conf'
     to /etc/nginx/conf/nginx.conf to preserve existing functionality.
 .
 WHATS NEW:
   - Extra modules are now dynamic instead of static.
   - ssl.conf TLS configuration updated to SSLLabs minimum recommendation
   - Description is now loaded into debian/rpm packages
 .
 This package provides a statically compiled version of nginx with the 
 complete set of standard modules included, in addition to several 
 OpenResty modules.
 .
 This package includes the latest version of OpenSSL 1.0.2 and PCRE 8.xx with 
 Cloudflare's ChaCha20+Poly1305 Patch.
 .
 Included with this package is a strong ssl.conf file which includes
 a recommended SSL config that can be included by default.
 .
